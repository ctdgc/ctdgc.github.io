Welcome to the landing page of the Central Texas Disc Golf (CTDG) Discord! We bring together disc golfers of all skill levels across Central Texas to connect and converse.

Our purpose is to foster a thriving disc golf community where you can meet other golfers, engage in conversations, and stay updated on news and events.

# Platform
Discord is a communication platform that combines text, voice, and video chat for community interactions. It's chosen by disc golfers for its user-friendly interface, focus on community engagement, and versatile communication options. You can access it through the Discord mobile app, desktop application, or any web browser.
